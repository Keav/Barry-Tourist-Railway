This year&#39;s event is to be held on Saturday 20th and Sunday 21st June centred on Barry Island Railway Station, the headquarters of the Barry Tourist Railway.</p>
        <br>
        <p>John said, &#8220;Last year&#39;s &#8216;Barry at War&#8217; event was a great success bringing over 40.000 people to Barry Island over our &#8216;Barry at War&#8217; weekend.  We&#39;re determined to make our 2015 event even better to mark the 70th Anniversary of the end of World War II. In this regard, the appearance of the WWII Avro Lancaster Bomber from the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight at our event will be particularly poignant&#8221;.</p>
        <br>
        <p>John went on to say, &#8220;We are keen to tell people about the history of Barry, particularly, the docks, the railway and the key role Barry played in the two World Wars&#39;. I am particularly proud of the &#8216;Barry at War Museum&#8217; that has been developed at Barry Island Station by our Barry at War Volunteer Group, headed up by Glenn Booker. This will be a key feature of the event with the re-enactors in period uniforms and dress, together with military and fashion displays, plus vintage stalls giving the station an authentic 1940&#39;s atmosphere. There&#39;s also a Jazz Festival going on!&#8221;</p>
        <br>
        <p>&#8220;Barry is a great place and we&#39;re so pleased that we have secured the Red Arrows and Avro Lancaster for our &#8216;Barry at War&#8217; event to help people understand more about the town&#39;s wartime history. This year, the Barry Tourist Railway and the Barry at War Museum will bring an additional 50,000 visitors to Barry to see and hear that story&#8221;, John concluded.'
