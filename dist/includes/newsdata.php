                <p><strong>CATCH THE TRAIN TO SEE THE RED ARROWS DISPLAY AT BARRY ISLAND</strong></p>

                <p>It&#39;s going to be a busy weekend at Barry Island this weekend where the island&#39;s biggest event of the year, The &#8216;Barry at War&#8217; Weekend is to be held featuring the fabulous Red Arrows Aerobatic Display on Saturday at 12.00hrs. The roads will be congested so why not catch the 15 minute train &#8220;PARK &amp; RIDE&#8221; SHUTTLE TRAIN service being operated by the Barry Tourist Railway from the Waterfront Station (CF62 5QR) to Barry Island STATION commencing at 09.15 hours.</p>

                <p>The two-centred event is to be held at Barry Island Railway Station, the headquarters of the Barry Tourist Railway, and the Promenade of Whitmore Bay. The centre-piece of the event will be the Red Arrows full display at 12.00hrs on Saturday 20<sup>th</sup> June at Whitmore Bay, Barry Island but there&#39;s plenty of other things to see on the Island including a Red Arrows simulator so that you can try flying a red RAF Hawk aircraft yourself!</p>

                <p>John Buxton, Director of the Barry Tourist Railway said, &#8220;We at the &#8216;Barry at War&#8217; team are really excited about the event and my Company, Cambrian Transport is pleased to be the main sponsor of this and the Red Arrows display. I&#39;m pleased to say that we have enlisted the support of many Barry Island Traders this year to help support the display including John&#39;s Café, Marco&#39;s, O&#39;Shea&#39;s Café and Danter&#39;s Fun Fair. Our last &#8216;Barry at War&#8217; event was a great success bringing over 40,000 people to Barry Island and year by year it&#39;s growing and growing!&#8221;</p>

                <p>The weekend is aimed at telling people about the history of Barry, particularly, the docks, the railway and the key role Barry played in the two World Wars&#39;. The &#8216;Barry at War&#8217; Museum&#39; will be open at Barry Island Station where there will be re-enactors in period uniforms and dress, together with military and fashion displays, plus vintage stalls giving the station an authentic 1940&#39;s atmosphere. There&#39;s also a Jazz Festival going on!&#8221;</p>

                <p>Further displays and military and vintage stalls will be set up behind the Promenade of Whitmore Bay.</p>

                <p>&#8220;Barry is a great place and we&#39;re so pleased that we have secured the Red Arrows for our &#8216;Barry at War&#8217; event to help people understand more about the town&#39;s wartime history. Why not come along in vintage clothes and really get into the swing&#8221;, concluded John.</p>

                <p>John Buxton, Managing Director of the Barry Tourist Railway Tourist Railway, is pleased to announce that he has again secured the Red Arrows and the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight for this year&#39;s &#8216;Barry at War&#8217; weekend. This year&#39;s event is to be held on Saturday 20th and Sunday 21st June centred on Barry Island Railway Station, the headquarters of the Barry Tourist Railway.</p>

                  <p>John said, &#8220;Last year&#39;s &#8216;Barry at War&#8217; event was a great success bringing over 40.000 people to Barry Island over our &#8216;Barry at War&#8217; weekend.  We&#39;re determined to make our 2015 event even better to mark the 70th Anniversary of the end of World War II. In this regard, the appearance of the WWII Avro Lancaster Bomber from the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight at our event will be particularly poignant&#8221;.</p>

                  <p>John went on to say, &#8220;We are keen to tell people about the history of Barry, particularly, the docks, the railway and the key role Barry played in the two World Wars&#39;. I am particularly proud of the &#8216;Barry at War Museum&#8217; that has been developed at Barry Island Station by our &#8216;Barry at War&#8217; Volunteer Group, headed up by Glenn Booker. This will be a key feature of the event with the re-enactors in period uniforms and dress, together with military and fashion displays, plus vintage stalls giving the station an authentic 1940&#39;s atmosphere. There&#39;s also a Jazz Festival going on!&#8221;</p>

                  <p>&#8220;Barry is a great place and we&#39;re so pleased that we have secured the Red Arrows and Avro Lancaster for our &#8216;Barry at War&#8217; event to help people understand more about the town&#39;s wartime history. This year, the Barry Tourist Railway and the &#8216;Barry at War&#8217; Museum will bring an additional 50,000 visitors to Barry to see and hear that story&#8221;, John concluded.</p>'
