Our last ‘RED ARROWS’ event brought over 40.000 people to Barry Island and year by year it’s growing and growing!’

The FESTIVAL OF TRANSPORT is becoming one of the biggest events of its kind in the country with an amazing display of road transport vehicles including vintage buses, lorries, cars, motor-cycles displays and military vehicles. There will also be auto jumble and vintage stalls on the promenade, not forgetting the superb Barry at War Museum inside Barry Island Station.
