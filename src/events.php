                        <br>
                        <p>The Barry Tourist Railway is running a shuttle service from their Waterfront Station, (off Hood Road opposite the Premier Inn) to Barry Island for the firework display on the evening of Wednesday 5th November.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>There is plenty of car parking space right behind the Waterfront Station platform and we will be running our 1950&#39;s vintage diesel railcar set &#39;IRIS II&#39;.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>The first train departs the Waterfront at 18.15hrs and trains run at 15 minute intervals until 19.30hrs.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>After the display ends, the shuttle service recommences from Barry Island Station to the Waterfront, with the last train leaving Barry Island at 21.00hrs.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Park and Ride fares are £5 for a family or group of up to 4 people and £10 for a vehicle up to 10 people.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>You can pay on the train (cash only).</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Step back in time on our vintage train and beat the Queues!</p>

                        <p>Our biggest event of the year featuring many historic military vehicles. There will be a large military exhibition and the military museum based in Barry Island Station will also be open, along with our Caf&#233;.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>For this event, we are pleased to say that we are partnering with <b>Barry at War Group</b>. Please visit their website <a href="http://www.barryatwar.info/wartime-weekend">www.barryatwar.info/wartime-weekend</a> for more information.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Be sure to also have a look at our <a href="index.php">HOME</a> page for more information about this special weekend.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p><b>Travel &amp; Parking</b></p>
                        <br>
                        <p>If you&#39;re planning to come to our event and to see the Red Arrows, we recommend that you come to the Waterfront site and park at the car park there or the overflow car park at the nearby Innovation Quarter and catch the shuttle train. The only road to the Island, Harbour Road is likely to be jammed. Park and ride on the train costs <b>&#163;5 for a car with up to 4 passengers</b> and <b>&#163;10 for a car &#47; MPV with 5- 10 passengers</b>... not much more than the car parking charge at the car parks on the Island... and this must be the cheapest steam haulage per person in the country to boot!</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>The next service after the Red Arrows display from Barry Island will depart at 13:05hrs and arrive at the Waterfront at 13:10hrs. The shuttle service will then recommence from the Waterfront to Barry Island at 13:15hrs with a 15&#47;20 minute shuttle service to&#47;from the Island which will operate until the last train - the 17:00hrs departure from Barry Island to the Waterfront.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>We will be running MET 1 on its own on Sunday hauling IRIS II stock. We will again be running a regular service but at half hourly intervals as we have to allow for the run-round moves. This service will again commence at 10:00hrs and the last train will depart from Barry island at 16:30hrs for the Waterfront.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>The Dakota fly past will now be at 14:40hrs and the plane will fly over both the Hood site and Barry Island Station. Again there will be a short break in the train service whilst the fly past takes place.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>As for Sunday, the event is likely to be very busy so park at the Waterfront and ride the steam train. Park and Ride fares are the same as for Saturday.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>This great event has something for everyone, come rain or shine.</p>
