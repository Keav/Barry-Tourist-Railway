This year we are keeping our fingers crossed for good weather’, concluded John

                He went on to say, ‘I’m keen to see the Festival of Transport grow to become one of the biggest in the country and will help as much as I can to help achieve this aim. In another role, I was one of the first sponsors of this event and now, with the Red Arrows coming, we’ve got the best promotion you could ever wish for’, said John.'
